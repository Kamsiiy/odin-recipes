    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Pancakes</strong> are flat, round cakes made from a batter that typically includes flour, eggs,
         milk, and butter. The batter is poured onto a hot surface like a griddle or frying pan and 
         cooked until golden brown on both sides. They can be thick and fluffy or thin and delicate, 
         depending on the recipe and cooking method.</p>
    <h3>About Pancakes</h3>
   <p><strong> Pancakes</strong> are a beloved dish enjoyed in many cultures around the world. Made from a
     simple batter of flour, eggs, milk, and butter, they are cooked on a hot surface until golden
      brown. Pancakes can vary widely in thickness and texture, from the thick and fluffy American style 
      to the thin and delicate <em>French crêpes.</em>

In the United States, pancakes are often served for breakfast with butter and maple syrup, but they 
can also be topped with fruits, nuts, or whipped cream. <em>French crêpes,</em> on the other hand, can be 
filled with sweet ingredients like Nutella and strawberries or savory fillings such as ham and cheese.

Pancakes have a long history, with evidence suggesting they were enjoyed by prehistoric societies. 
Today, they remain a versatile and easy-to-make dish that can be adapted to suit different tastes and 
dietary needs. Whether enjoyed for breakfast, brunch, or dessert, pancakes offer a comforting and
 satisfying meal.</p>

    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

 <h3>Steps in making Pancakes</h3>
<ol>
   <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder,
       1 tablespoon of sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir well.</li>
       <li><strong>Add the Wet Ingredients:</strong> Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Crack 1 large egg into the well, then pour in 1 cup of milk 
         and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. 
         Mix until just combined. The batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
         <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly 
            grease it with butter or oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook 
               until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip
                and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings like maple syrup, 
                  fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
