    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><strong>Jollof rice</strong> is a visually striking dish with its deep red hue,
        achieved through the use of tomatoes(fresh tomatoes or tin tomatoes)
        and peppers.The rice is cooked in a rich tomato-based sauce,which is infused with a blend of spices,
        giving it a complex and aromatic flavor.The dish often includes vegetables like onions and bell peppers,and can 
        be paired with various proteins suh as chicken,beef,or fish.The texture of the rice is fluffy yet slightly sticky,absorbing
        the flavors of the sauce perfectly.
